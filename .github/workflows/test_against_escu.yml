# The default branch of security_content should always be correct.
# As such, we should use it in our test workflow, here, to ensure
# that contentctl is also correct and does not throw unexpected errors.

# We should remember that if contentctl introduces NEW validations that have
# note yet been fixed in security_content, we may see this workflow fail.
