# Maximum length of the name field for a search.
# This number is derived from a limitation that exists in
# ESCU where a search cannot be edited, due to validation
# errors, if its name is longer than 99 characters.
# When an saved search is cloned in Enterprise Security User Interface,
# it is wrapped in the following:
# {Detection.tags.security_domain} - {SEARCH_STANZA_NAME} - Rule
# Similarly, when we generate the search stanza name in contentctl, it
# is app.label - detection.name - Rule
# However, in product the search name is:
# {CustomApp.label} - {detection.name} - Rule,
# or in ESCU:
# ESCU - {detection.name} - Rule,
# this gives us a maximum length below.
# When an ESCU search is cloned, it will
# have a full name like (the following is NOT a typo):
# Endpoint - ESCU - Name of Search From YML File - Rule - Rule
# The math below accounts for all these caveats
